But I feel that <b>the Big Issue has now been hijacked by beggars from other countries</b>, who are taking advantage of our generosity. Because of this, <b>although I used to buy one, I always refuse nowadays</b>” <i>Jane, Cumbria</i></p><p>“<b>I feel annoyed because most the sellers where I live are immigrants who can be very aggressive and rude. Most of them have plenty of money and large council houses</b>” <i>Jo G, Hexham</i></p><p>“<b>I think many of the sellers should have graduated to real jobs by now</b> if the experience of selling the magazine was encouraging them to learn how to organise themselves for working life. I know at least two sellers who have been selling the magazine from the same street position for many years, at least eight years in one case” <i>Anon</i></p><p>“I just tell them I have one and walk on by. I think these people should not be allowed to sell them as <b>they use the money to buy drink and drugs</b>” <i>John, Perth</i></p><p>“I used to always buy one but I stopped when the man I bought from left his normal post; he had found work. I then realised that <b>all the ones who approached me didn't speak English</b>. <b>It has also increased in price so much that I don't think it is good enough value</b>” <i>Joyce, London</i></p><h3>'I'm happy to be approached to buy a Big Issue'</h3><ul><li>Some of you said you were happy to buy a Big Issue, mainly because you feel like it’s helping the seller, while others said they never bought one but didn’t mind being asked.</li></ul><p>“<b>I have no negative feelings when being asked to buy the big issue</b>. I feel largely positive and would consider buying a copy. <b>I feel that it is a worthwhile charity</b>” <i>Anon</i></p><p>“Generally I have sympathy for their situation, something I do not have for beggars. <b>Most sellers I encounter are polite and do not push for a sale</b>. I have no interest in buying the mag in any event” <i>Anon</i></p><img _ngcontent-yg-app-c2171288495 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ygo-assets-websites-editorial-emea.yougov.net/images/Cameron-issue.format-webp.webp alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>“Because I know they are usually more polite than standard beggars, I am not afraid to say ‘No, thank you’. <b>Sometimes they are so gracious after receiving a no, that it makes me decide to head back to them on my way home and get a copy</b>” <i>Anon</i></p><p>“<b>I don't mind being asked, but do not buy because I support other homeless charities like the Salvation Army and Shelter</b>” <i>Helen, Dover</i></p><p>“Not bothered until I get to the fifth Big Issue seller in half a mile walking through Leeds. … <b>The current bunch seems better mannered and less aggressive than a few years ago. I am always polite when asked politely, but am just not interested in the magazine they are selling </b>– wrong demographic I guess” <i>Jim, West Yorkshire</i></p><p>“<b>I don’t mind and sometimes give them the money but don’t take the mag</b>” <i>Biddy, Cheshire</i></p><h3>'I feel uncomfortable when I'm asked if I want to buy a Big Issue'</h3><ul><li>Participants who felt uncomfortable being asked to buy a Big Issue said that they often felt guilty not buying one, and wish sellers didn’t approach them.</li></ul><p>“<b>I feel pleased that the person is trying to succeed and better themselves, but I wish it was publicly known just how much the magazine actually is</b>. I would really like to purchase from the person, but would feel embarrassed if the price was too expensive for me” <b>Jean P, Hertfordshire</b></p><p>“<b>I sometimes feel guilty if I can't buy one</b>. It is sometimes a bit too expensive for me personally, but <b>occasionally the actual seller just draws me in and makes me want to buy it from them</b>. For example, once a guy had two dogs with him who I felt sorry for so I bought two copies!” <i>Anon</i></p><p>“<b>I feel uncomfortable</b>. If the Big Issue was a well-written and decent magazine then I would buy it. However, <b>I feel like the magazine is taking advantage of the fact it is sold by homeless to guilt-trip people into buying something which is not worth reading</b>” <i>Anon</i></p><img _ngcontent-yg-app-c2171288495 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ygo-assets-websites-editorial-emea.yougov.net/images/BigIssue.format-webp.webp alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>“<b>Slightly embarrassed, perhaps, as my income is probably less than theirs</b> being, as I am without benefits and at the mercy of pitiful interest rates and I'm therefore unable to help. <b>I also feel that it doesn't work very well, as I have been seeing the same guy selling it in the same place for at least the last 10 years</b>” <i>AG, London</i></p><p>“<b>Uncomfortable: I don't want to buy it</b>, but refusing is awkward as I don't want to cause offence. Then again, <b>I also feel slightly annoyed that they put me in the position of having to refuse</b>. I feel that they shouldn't ask me to buy and that <b>if I wanted the magazine I would have approached them</b>” <i>Claire, Cleveland</i></p><p>“Usually, <b>I feel embarrassed </b>and politely decline.

I am also very aware that <b>in the current financial climate it would be very difficult to get out of that situation</b>” <i>Lorna, Preston</i></p><p>“<b>These are people who have been entirely let down by society</b>. No matter what happens, or how much the person involved is at fault, <b>we as a community should never allow a situation to deteriorate to the point where a person does not have a roof over their head</b>” <i>Anon</i></p><p>“<b>Bad luck could have put them in this situation. It is something that could happen to any of us</b>” <i>Anon</i></p><p>“<b>In many cases, the circumstances around becoming homeless are not directly controlled by the person concerned</b>. I've slept outside enough times to know that it's not a pleasant experience in many weathers, even without winter conditions” <i>Alex S, Edinburgh</i></p><p>“<b>I feel sorry for the homeless because it is a very hard and cruel way to live, and most are there through no fault of their own</b>. Others can be very unkind about the homeless, and don't see the people, just a problem to be avoided. They may have problems but have no-one to help get them out of trouble” <i>Tan, Bournemouth</i></p><h3>'I do not feel sorry for homeless people'</h3><ul><li>Those who said they did not feel sorry for homeless people justified their perception by arguing that in most cases their situation was self-inflicted, and that they felt homeless individuals choose not to take advantage of help this is available.</li></ul><p>“<b>In the majority of cases, the reasons for homelessness are self-inflicted</b>, and it seems like <b>some people don't try hard enough</b> by, for example, getting a job in order to support a home of their own” <i>Anon</i></p><img _ngcontent-yg-app-c2171288495 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ygo-assets-websites-editorial-emea.yougov.net/images/homeless-sign.format-webp.webp alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>“<b>A lot of resources are in place to help homeless people, yet many choose to be homeless</b>” <i>Neil, Burnham</i></p><p>“It's impossible to know any of the individual circumstances, but <b>when they are seen with cigarettes and cans/bottles of alcohol it's very difficult to feel sorry for them</b>”<i> Dave, Tamworth</i></p><p>“<b>They are homeless because of their own choices in life. Today's welfare system overpays the lazy and feckless</b>” <i>Anon</i></p><p>“<b>Mostly it is self-inflicted in some way; a behavioural way. Also they do get benefits – tax money – so why do they not use this to find a place to stay?</b>” <i>William, Lincolnshire</i><b></b></p><p>“<b>Because everyone gets housing of some sort from the government unless they mess up their lives totally with drink, drugs, or criminal behaviour</b>.
