This means that he is 39 years old, soon to be 40 years. While he is popularly referred to as Ronaldinho Gaucho, his parents gave him the name Ronaldo De Assis Moreira at birth. He attended Colégio Santa Teresa de Jesus.</p><p class=align-left>His parents are João de Assis Moreira, who is the father, and Dona Miguelina Elói Assis dos Santos, the mother. His father was a welder in a shipyard, whereas the mother, who is a former cosmetic saleswoman, is now a nurse. Before retiring from football, his father was working at Gremio, one of Porto Alegre's big clubs as a match-day doorman.</p><p class=align-left>The footballer was lucky to have come from a family with football history. His father was a former football player. Ronaldinho brother Roberto de Assis Moreira, who is commonly known as Assis, was also a former footballer. He also has a sister by the name Deisy, who is his biggest supporter. She handles all of Ronaldinho's press matters.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/a4dbead879704a99.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Georgina Rodríguez’s biography: who is Cristiano Ronaldo’s girlfriend?</span></p></a><h3>Ronaldinho football career</h3><p class=align-left>The football star had a lot of inspiration to venture into the sport. His older brother, who is 10 years his senior, was a player with Gremio. He was able to move his family from the slums to a better life. Unfortunately, his prospects of becoming a world star ended when he suffered a serious knee injury that ended his career.</p><p class=align-left>Fortunately, his younger brother was an even better talent, as proven a few years later. Assis went on to manage his younger brother Ronaldinho who became one of the best in the world. He remained a big influence on him as an agent and role model. Ronaldo later moved from his home country to the French side PSG. All the while, he acknowledged his brother's contribution to his success. It is not surprising that he mentioned Assis during his 2005 acceptance speech at the FIFA World Player of the Year Award ceremony.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/8d44729c4f6dd1a2.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Gian Luca Passi de Preposulo’s biography: who is Jessica Chastain’s husband?</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Was Ronaldinho the best in his prime? Yes, he was, thanks to his brother's efforts. Most people know and believe that Ronaldinho was behind the numerous tricks he used on the field. The star player revealed that a good number of these stunts were invented by Roberto who then passed them on to him. They include:</p><ul><li>Ball dribbling and handling both on ground and air</li><li>Bending knees while dribbling</li><li>Not staring at the ball</li><li>Performing moves at least one meter from the opponent</li><li>Constant acceleration after every move</li></ul><p class=align-left>All the above-mentioned tricks were instrumental in making Ronaldinho the star that he later became. With the basic above, by the age of 7 years, Ronaldinho was able to have full control of the ball while dribbling.</p><p class=align-left>He could also head up balls with precision, not to mention the fact that he was able to control the ball using his imagination amazingly. The training he had at an early age, and outside his comfort zone, was responsible for his ability to develop unique skills that he became known for. Some of his unique skills include:</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/bd0227fbedf15ba3.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=30><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Miguel Herrán biography: age, height, girlfriend, net worth</span></p></a><ul><li>Flipflap or Elastico</li><li>No-Look passing and dribbling</li><li>Patented free kicks</li><li>Hocus Pocus</li><li>Joga Bonito dribble</li></ul><p class=align-left>Ronaldinho's success story began when his brother, Roberto, was no longer able to fend for his family after a knee injury. The young boy Ronaldo at the time juggled both Futsal and soccer. He had to step up. He put in more effort at both sports, and he soon began getting recognized.</p><p class=align-left>It is from his skills and prowess at the time that fans endorsed the name Ronaldinho, which means small Ronaldo. He became the little boy with great skills. What's more, the player continued to be the smallest among all others during his academy years.</p><p class=align-left>He was combining the skills taught to him by his brother with studying great players in history, such as Pele gave Ronaldinho an edge over his competitors.
