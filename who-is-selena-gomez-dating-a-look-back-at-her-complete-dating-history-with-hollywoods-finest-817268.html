Selena’s dating portfolio could rival a&nbsp;<a href=# title=Hollywood data-link=tag>Hollywood</a> casting agency. <a href=# title="Selena Gomez" data-link=tag>Selena Gomez</a>’s love life has been a&nbsp;whirlwind of&nbsp;passionate entanglements and bittersweet goodbyes.</p><p>We’ll decipher the clues, decode the headlines, and expose the truth (and maybe a&nbsp;few juicy details) behind her <a href=# title=relationship data-link=tag>relationship</a> rollercoaster. And also who Selena Gomez is&nbsp;dating in&nbsp;2024. Prepare for laughter, gasps, and maybe even a&nbsp;tear or&nbsp;two, because this love story is&nbsp;unfiltered and unapologetic.</p><p><h2>1. Nick Jonas</h2></p><p>Selena Gomez’s <a href=# title=romantic data-link=tag>romantic</a> journey with Nick Jonas began in&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>2008</a>, ignited by&nbsp;their shared connection in&nbsp;the Disney Channel universe. The initial spark occurred when Gomez was spotted skateboarding in&nbsp;Jonas’ Elvis Costello t-shirt, and their interactions heightened during the Disney Channel Games, where Gomez spent time with all three Jonas Brothers in&nbsp;March of&nbsp;that year.</p><p>Amidst whispers and speculation, the burning question emerges&nbsp;— “Who is&nbsp;Selena Gomez dating?” Rumors of&nbsp;a&nbsp;budding romance intensified when Gomez appeared in&nbsp;Jonas’ “<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Burnin’ Up</a>” music video in&nbsp;June. Despite a&nbsp;cozy backstage photo in&nbsp;Rolling Stone, the Jonas Brothers’ camp maintained a&nbsp;“just <a href=# title=friends data-link=tag>friends</a>” stance. The truth, however, was simmering under the surface: a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>source</a> revealed they’d been dating in&nbsp;secret for months.</p><p>Their relationship continued to&nbsp;evolve with public sightings at&nbsp;events. Despite their growing closeness, Gomez opted not to&nbsp;confirm their romance in&nbsp;October of&nbsp;the same year, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>stating</a>, “<strong>Nick and&nbsp;I are getting to&nbsp;know each other, but we’re not confirming anything.</strong>”</p><p>Although the couple parted ways in&nbsp;2009, their story took a&nbsp;twist when they rekindled their romance in&nbsp;early <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>2010</a>. Rumors circulated as&nbsp;they were spotted together in&nbsp;February, sharing a&nbsp;dinner date and a&nbsp;golf outing. Jonas, at&nbsp;the time, expressed a&nbsp;desire to&nbsp;keep their renewed relationship private.</p><p>“I&nbsp;think when it&nbsp;comes to&nbsp;that, I&nbsp;try to&nbsp;keep it&nbsp;a&nbsp;bit to&nbsp;myself and keep it&nbsp;a&nbsp;bit private. We&nbsp;always try to&nbsp;find time to&nbsp;go&nbsp;out and hang out with people we&nbsp;enjoy spending time with, and as&nbsp;far as&nbsp;that future of&nbsp;that relationship goes, I&nbsp;will keep that to&nbsp;myself for right now,” <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>said</a> Jonas.</p><p>However, their second chapter didn’t endure, and by&nbsp;March, sources <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>revealed</a> that “they were an&nbsp;item, but they are no&nbsp;longer together.” Despite the breakup, Gomez and Jonas remained friends and were seen hanging out in&nbsp;2015. Reflecting on&nbsp;their past relationship, Gomez described it&nbsp;as&nbsp;“puppy love” and expressed her fondness for Jonas.</p><p>“<strong>We&nbsp;were babies</strong>! We&nbsp;actually caught up&nbsp;the other day, and it’s really fun to&nbsp;be&nbsp;able to&nbsp;do&nbsp;that. That, to&nbsp;me, was like puppy love. It&nbsp;was very sweet. He’s lovely. I&nbsp;do have a&nbsp;love for him, for sure,” Gomez <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>shared</a>.</p><p>Adding a&nbsp;humorous twist, Gomez acknowledged that, despite the relationship not lasting, she gained one of&nbsp;the most important friendships in&nbsp;her life&nbsp;— with <a href=# title="Taylor Swift" data-link=tag>Taylor Swift</a>. Jonas later recounted a&nbsp;memorable double date in&nbsp;Central Park with Gomez, Swift, and his brother Joe in&nbsp;2018.</p><p>“We&nbsp;were in&nbsp;Central Park, and we&nbsp;were very private about our relationship ... I&nbsp;walked about 20&nbsp;feet away from her. Even though they were taking pictures of&nbsp;us, and obviously we&nbsp;were there together, it&nbsp;was like, ’It would be&nbsp;better if&nbsp;we&nbsp;stand about 25&nbsp;feet apart.’ So&nbsp;it&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>ruined</a> her Central Park experience, so&nbsp;her and Taylor Swift, who was dating my&nbsp;brother Joe, walked 25&nbsp;feet behind&nbsp;us as&nbsp;we&nbsp;walked through the park by&nbsp;ourselves,” Jonas shared.</p><p><h2>2. Taylor Lautner</h2></p><p>After her first breakup with Jonas, Selena Gomez sparked brief dating rumors with Taylor Lautner in&nbsp;April 2009. While working on&nbsp;separate projects in&nbsp;<a href=# title=Canada data-link=tag>Canada</a>, their paths crossed, with Gomez even staying at&nbsp;the same hotel as&nbsp;Lautner’s Twilight co-star <a href=# title="Kristen Stewart" data-link=tag>Kristen Stewart</a>. Numerous chance encounters led to&nbsp;hangouts, including a&nbsp;dinner outing with friends and a&nbsp;cozy movie date, where their closeness fueled speculation.</p><p>“They were cuddling throughout the movie and sat very close together. [They were] definitely acting like they were boyfriend and girlfriend,” an&nbsp;observer <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>revealed</a>. However, a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>source</a> clarified that they were just friends at&nbsp;the time. The fling seemed to&nbsp;fizzle out upon returning to&nbsp;<a href=# title="Los Angeles" data-link=tag>Los Angeles</a>, with only one sighting afterwards.</p><p>Reflecting on&nbsp;the situation later, Gomez <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>told</a> <i>Seventeen</i> that the <a href=# title=media data-link=tag>media</a> blew things out of&nbsp;proportion. “Taylor has made me&nbsp;so&nbsp;happy. I&nbsp;didn’t know&nbsp;I could be&nbsp;that happy. He’s a&nbsp;great guy. But I’m 100 percent single, and I’m going to&nbsp;keep it&nbsp;that way for a&nbsp;while,” she <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>explained</a>.</p><p><h2>3. Justin Bieber</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/6cb/8d1/07972f5c58b8c4215ce0f4f04f.jpg><p>AXELLE / BAUER-GRIFFIN.COM / East News</p><p>One of&nbsp;the most widely publicized and talked-about relationships in&nbsp;Selena Gomez’s dating history is&nbsp;her on-again, off-again romance with pop sensation Justin Bieber. The two stars began dating in&nbsp;2010, sparking the start of&nbsp;“Jelena.” The couple’s relationship faced numerous ups and downs, making headlines with each reconciliation and breakup.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/520/e1a/06951d59268d618a6c9554fc3e.jpg><p>bauergriffinonline.com / East News</p><p>In&nbsp;the early months of&nbsp;2009, Selena Gomez’s introduction to&nbsp;Justin Bieber was orchestrated by&nbsp;Bieber’s manager, Scooter Braun, who reached out to&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Gomez’s mother</a>. This connection occurred shortly after Bieber openly declared Gomez as&nbsp;his celebrity crush. What initially began as&nbsp;a&nbsp;friendship took a&nbsp;notable turn on&nbsp;New Year’s Eve that same year when Bieber serenaded Gomez on&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Dick Clark’s New Year’s Rockin’ Eve</a>. By&nbsp;February, Gomez expressed fondness for Bieber in&nbsp;an&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>MTV News</a> <a href=# title=interview data-link=tag>interview</a>, likening their relationship to&nbsp;that of&nbsp;a&nbsp;big sister wanting to&nbsp;protect her younger brother.</p><p>“I&nbsp;feel like a&nbsp;big sister now, ’cause I&nbsp;want to&nbsp;protect him. So&nbsp;I’m always very cautious with him, but he&nbsp;is&nbsp;so&nbsp;talented, and he’s so&nbsp;sweet, so&nbsp;that just started&nbsp;us wanting to&nbsp;work together. Now he’s just become one of&nbsp;my&nbsp;good friends,” Gomez said.</p><p>Despite initial denials of&nbsp;any romantic involvement, the pair’s connection became evident towards the end of&nbsp;2010 when they were spotted leaving an&nbsp;IHOP together, arm-in-arm. The official confirmation of&nbsp;their relationship came during their New Year’s celebration in&nbsp;St. Lucia, with photos emerging of&nbsp;the couple sharing a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>kiss on&nbsp;a&nbsp;yacht</a>. Their public debut on&nbsp;the red carpet took place at&nbsp;the Vanity Fair Oscars party in&nbsp;February.</p><p>While they waited until May to&nbsp;confirm their relationship officially, Gomez <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>clarified</a> that she didn’t want to&nbsp;“hide” her love life. The following months saw an&nbsp;increase in&nbsp;public displays of&nbsp;affection, including a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>notable kiss</a> at&nbsp;the 2011 Billboard Music Awards and Bieber <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>renting out</a> the Staples Center for a&nbsp;private movie night with Gomez in&nbsp;September.</p><p>Despite their high-profile appearances, the couple faced challenges, leading to&nbsp;their breakup in&nbsp;November 2012 after nearly two years together. Sources indicated that Gomez initiated the breakup due to&nbsp;trust issues exacerbated by&nbsp;their <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>frequent separation</a>.</p><p>A&nbsp;brief separation followed, but in&nbsp;April 2013, Bieber’s throwback photos with Gomez and her attendance at&nbsp;one of&nbsp;his concerts in&nbsp;Norway sparked reconciliation rumors. This marked the beginning of&nbsp;an&nbsp;on-and-off phase in&nbsp;their relationship. However, in&nbsp;December of&nbsp;the same year, Bieber confirmed their split, acknowledging the challenges of&nbsp;navigating a&nbsp;public breakup.</p><p>The couple found themselves back together in&nbsp;August 2014, sharing <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>glimpses</a> of&nbsp;their relationship on&nbsp;<a href=# title="social media" data-link=tag>social media</a>. However, by&nbsp;November, they had once again called it&nbsp;quits. During this tumultuous period, Gomez confirmed that her song “<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>The Heart Wants What It&nbsp;Wants</i></a>” was <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>inspired</a> by&nbsp;Bieber, expressing ongoing care for him even when they were apart.</p><p>Bieber and Gomez’s romance was intense and turbulent, marked by&nbsp;passionate love and dramatic fights. They even cohabited briefly, but the pressure was too much at&nbsp;their young ages. Though deeply invested, they struggled with unhealthy patterns in&nbsp;their relationship.</p><p>After a&nbsp;brief rekindling in&nbsp;2015, things became complicated again. While Bieber publicly <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>expressed</a> his love for Gomez, he&nbsp;was soon seen with his now-wife Hailey. Gomez tried to&nbsp;move&nbsp;on, publicly stating her desire to&nbsp;end talk about the relationship.</p><p>Despite their statements, the cycle continued. They reunited in&nbsp;2016, only to&nbsp;have Bieber lash out at&nbsp;fans criticizing his new girlfriend. Gomez responded, hinting at&nbsp;infidelity in&nbsp;their past. They remained apart for a&nbsp;year before another reconciliation, seemingly lasting until early 2018.</p><p>Reflecting on&nbsp;the relationship later, Gomez acknowledged experiencing difficult challenges but found strength in&nbsp;moving&nbsp;on. “<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Lose You to&nbsp;Love&nbsp;Me</i></a>” became her anthem for closure, accepting the bittersweet ending while embracing a&nbsp;new chapter.</p><p><h2>4. Zedd</h2></p><p>Zedd’s Instagram became a&nbsp;minefield of&nbsp;romantic breadcrumbs as&nbsp;he&nbsp;and Selena co-created musical magic. Fans deciphered every post, leading to&nbsp;whispers of&nbsp;a&nbsp;budding romance amidst the studio sessions. By&nbsp;the end of&nbsp;January, sparks were flying.</p><p>After several joint sightings, Zedd whisked himself to&nbsp;Atlanta to&nbsp;be&nbsp;with Gomez as&nbsp;she filmed <i>The Fundamentals of&nbsp;Caregiving.</i> A&nbsp;later <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>group photo</a> captured their closeness, with Zedd’s arms <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>gently wrapped</a> around her.</p><p>Their whirlwind romance ultimately faded, but even months later, Selena’s heart held warmth for Zedd. “I&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>adore</a> Anton [Zedd] a&nbsp;lot and&nbsp;I definitely had a&nbsp;thing with him, which was nice.” The glare of&nbsp;publicity eventually <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>took its toll</a> on&nbsp;Zedd, casting a&nbsp;shadow over his otherwise positive experience with Selena. He&nbsp;later confessed that navigating the media frenzy surrounding their relationship had been challenging at&nbsp;best.</p><p><h2>5. Niall Horan<br></h2></p><p>In&nbsp;swirling rumors, Selena Gomez finds herself in&nbsp;the spotlight, with fans eager to&nbsp;uncover the answer to&nbsp;the burning question, “Who is&nbsp;Selena Gomez dating?” “Oh&nbsp;my&nbsp;god! No,” Gomez <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>laughed</a>, addressing the dating rumors swirling around her and Niall Horan. “I&nbsp;love him, I&nbsp;always have. He’s amazing,” she clarified, setting the record straight. Despite <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>grabbing dinner</a> in&nbsp;Malibu with Horan and friends after the American Music Awards, their outing sparked speculation that quickly escalated when they were reportedly spotted <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>getting cozy</a> at&nbsp;Jenna Dewan’s birthday bash a&nbsp;week later.</p><p>Sources insisted they were just friends, but Gomez’s Instagram activity, including liking photos of&nbsp;Horan, only fueled the fire. Throughout December, the pair continued to&nbsp;be&nbsp;seen together, leading to&nbsp;whispers of&nbsp;date nights. Yet, Gomez remained adamant, denying any romantic involvement.</p><p><h2>6. Samuel Krost</h2></p><p>During the period when Gomez was associated with Horan, she was also seen in&nbsp;the company of&nbsp;Samuel Krost, a&nbsp;sales and merchandising executive who is&nbsp;a&nbsp;close friend of&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Gigi Hadid</a>. Following their photographed outing in&nbsp;New York City in&nbsp;November 2015, they were observed together once more in&nbsp;early 2016 while on&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>vacation</a> with a&nbsp;group of&nbsp;friends. In&nbsp;January of&nbsp;the same year, Gomez was photographed holding hands with Krost as&nbsp;they departed from a&nbsp;dinner date at&nbsp;the SLS Hotel.<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#> An&nbsp;eyewitness</a> informed PEOPLE that the pair “seemed super happy together.”</p><p>Merely a&nbsp;few nights later, Gomez and Krost were once again seen, this time <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>enjoying a&nbsp;dinner</a> at&nbsp;Nobu with another friend. Despite their frequent appearances together, Gomez asserted her <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>single status</a> while celebrating Valentine’s Day just a&nbsp;few weeks later.</p><p>Subsequently, the duo seemed to&nbsp;take a&nbsp;break from each other, but in&nbsp;2019, they were linked once more&nbsp;— though Gomez promptly <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>dismissed</a> the dating speculations.</p><p><h2>7. Charlie Puth</h2></p><p>Fans are always curious about Selena’s personal life, and one of&nbsp;the most frequently asked questions&nbsp;is, “Who is&nbsp;Selena Gomez dating?” Back in&nbsp;March 2016, Charlie Puth and Selena Gomez were trying to&nbsp;brush off the rumors that they were a&nbsp;thing, even though everyone was <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>talking about&nbsp;it</a>. It&nbsp;took Charlie a&nbsp;couple of&nbsp;years to&nbsp;finally spill the beans and admit that, yeah, they were actually dating.</p><p>In&nbsp;an&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>interview</a> with Billboard, he&nbsp;spilled that their relationship was quick and didn’t last long, but it&nbsp;hit him hard. Putting it&nbsp;plainly, he&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>said</a>, “I&nbsp;wasn’t the only one on&nbsp;her mind, and&nbsp;I kinda knew that from the start, you know? I&nbsp;guess&nbsp;I was getting myself into something messy.”</p><p><h2>8. The Weeknd</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/f5e/582/359fee5f7da0b9844646014610.jpg><p>Gomez reportedly met the Weeknd for the first time at&nbsp;the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>2015 Victoria’s Secret Fashion Show</a>, where they were both performers. It&nbsp;wasn’t until 2017 that things turned romantic for the pair, who went public that January during a&nbsp;romantic dinner date at&nbsp;Giorgio Baldi. Things quickly escalated, with the duo traveling to&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Italy</a> just weeks after first being spotted together. And they officially made their debut on&nbsp;Instagram just in&nbsp;time for Coachella in&nbsp;April 2017.</p><p>Following their European adventure, Gomez joined The Weeknd on&nbsp;tour, even exploring his hometown of&nbsp;Toronto. They shared glimpses of&nbsp;their relationship on&nbsp;social media, documenting their <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Coachella weekend</a>.</p><p>In&nbsp;May, the couple made their <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>red carpet debut</a> at&nbsp;the Met Gala, receiving approval from Gomez’s mother. During the summer, while The Weeknd continued touring, Gomez underwent a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>kidney transplant</a>. Despite his demanding schedule, the musician reportedly adjusted his commitments to&nbsp;support Gomez during her surgery and recovery. There were even hints that he&nbsp;considered donating a&nbsp;kidney, as&nbsp;suggested in&nbsp;his song “<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Call Out My&nbsp;Name</i></a>” with the lyrics “I&nbsp;almost cut a&nbsp;piece of&nbsp;myself for your life.”</p><p>After the surgery, they called it&nbsp;quits the following month. According to&nbsp;a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>source</a>, “She and Abel have been going back and forth for a&nbsp;few months about their relationship. It’s been hard with him being on&nbsp;tour and her shooting in&nbsp;New York. That wasn’t easy on&nbsp;them.” The same source added, “It’s been hard for them to&nbsp;come to&nbsp;the realization that this is&nbsp;the direction things were heading, but it’s been hard for months.”</p><p><h2>9. Benny Blanco</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/c90/8ab/b6d7a651aa9fa64aaae104dbda.jpg><p>B4859 / Avalon / Photoshot / East News<span>, </span>B4859 / Avalon / Photoshot / East News</p><p>In&nbsp;December 2023, Gomez appeared to&nbsp;validate her relationship with Blanco through a&nbsp;series of&nbsp;comments on&nbsp;Instagram. A&nbsp;fan shared a&nbsp;photo of&nbsp;the couple, and Gomez <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>expressed</a>, “He&nbsp;is&nbsp;my&nbsp;absolute everything in&nbsp;my&nbsp;heart.” In&nbsp;another comment, she described Blanco as&nbsp;the “best thing that’s ever happened” to&nbsp;her.
