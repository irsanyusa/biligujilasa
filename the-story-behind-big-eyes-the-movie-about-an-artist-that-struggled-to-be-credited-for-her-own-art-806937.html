That’s what happened to&nbsp;artist Margaret Keane, who had to&nbsp;fight a&nbsp;court battle against her own ex-husband, who claimed authorship of&nbsp;her canvases and made millions from selling them, in&nbsp;order to&nbsp;be&nbsp;recognized for her creations. Her story was told in&nbsp;the 2014&nbsp;film, <i>Big Eyes</i>, showing the public the truth about one of&nbsp;the biggest frauds in&nbsp;the art world.</p><p>At&nbsp;<strong>Bright Side</strong>, we&nbsp;were moved by&nbsp;the film and decided to&nbsp;share the true story of&nbsp;an&nbsp;artist’s struggle in&nbsp;the 1950s that inspired the plot of&nbsp;the script.</p><p><h2>The beginning of&nbsp;it&nbsp;all</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/6bd/748/4272ca511697ee6e306dc3db2a.png><p><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Born</a> in&nbsp;1927, in&nbsp;Tennessee, Peggy Doris Hawkins (or&nbsp;Margaret Doris Hawkins, as&nbsp;some sources claim) would later be&nbsp;known as&nbsp;the painter, Margaret Keane. The artist, who paid lots of&nbsp;attention to&nbsp;people’s eyes in&nbsp;order to&nbsp;better understand them after injuring her ear at&nbsp;the age of&nbsp;2, entered the art world at&nbsp;the age of&nbsp;10. At&nbsp;18, she studied at&nbsp;the Traphagen School of&nbsp;Design in&nbsp;New York, where she stayed for 1&nbsp;year. Shortly thereafter, in&nbsp;the 1950s, Margaret got a&nbsp;job painting cribs and baby clothes.</p><p><h2>The beginning of&nbsp;her career</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/58f/a35/a26a3b53f4800f3f7b10804714.png><p>Early in&nbsp;her career, she liked to&nbsp;experiment with a&nbsp;style known as&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>kitsch</a>, which is&nbsp;characterized by&nbsp;works that have a&nbsp;popular appearance, sometimes referred to&nbsp;as&nbsp;“hackneyed.” To&nbsp;paint, she used everything from acrylic dyes to&nbsp;oils. At&nbsp;the same time, Margaret had divorced her first husband and moved to&nbsp;San Francisco, California.</p><p>She revealed that some of&nbsp;her biggest inspirations for her works came from artists like <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Vincent van Gogh</a>, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Pablo Picasso</a>, and the way <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Amedeo Modigliani</a> painted women. His paintings always showed children or&nbsp;animals with huge eyes with sad expressions, which later stood out from the other popular works of&nbsp;the time and delighted art collectors.</p><p><h2>Her marriage to&nbsp;Walter Keane</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/bee/bb0/04364f503391ef8ef8f9902599.png><p>Shortly after <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>moving</a> to&nbsp;San Francisco with her daughter, she met Walter Keane, who, in&nbsp;1955, became her second husband. Thanks to&nbsp;her, Walter changed his job from real estate to&nbsp;art. The marriage, however, was not so&nbsp;harmonious and went through a&nbsp;series of&nbsp;complications. He&nbsp;was known to&nbsp;be&nbsp;very jealous and, many times, Margaret had to&nbsp;produce his paintings even though she did not feel like doing&nbsp;so.</p><p>Walter, in&nbsp;spite of&nbsp;everything, made <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>sure</a> that production was not affected, and while he&nbsp;worked away, Margaret painted continuously. At&nbsp;that time, she hadn’t received an&nbsp;ounce of&nbsp;credit for her efforts.</p><p><h2>Her husband’s outreach and resounding success</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/c36/6ec/8dc6a15a64a1fd7be15cec3550.png><p>Initially, her paintings were <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>sold</a> in&nbsp;a&nbsp;club in&nbsp;the city where she lived, called The Hungry i. She signed her art with the name, “Keane.” Walter was an&nbsp;excellent salesman and invested heavily in&nbsp;promoting the art that helped Margaret’s paintings gain great notoriety in&nbsp;the art circle, and they went on&nbsp;to&nbsp;sell for millions of&nbsp;dollars. This happened in&nbsp;the 1960s.</p><p>The works became so&nbsp;famous that they became <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>known</a> as&nbsp;“Keane eyes” or&nbsp;“big-eyed waifs.” Walter said he&nbsp;was inspired by&nbsp;the orphaned children he&nbsp;had met in&nbsp;his travels. Within a&nbsp;short time, Margaret’s work started getting used in&nbsp;designs for objects and other products on&nbsp;an&nbsp;industrial scale.</p><p>This drew negative reviews from specialists, although the public was enchanted by&nbsp;the unique and touching look of&nbsp;the paintings. What Margaret didn’t know (but would later find out) was that her husband was taking all the credit for her creations, which ended in&nbsp;a&nbsp;court battle and several years of&nbsp;struggle to&nbsp;gain the recognition she deserved.</p><p><h2>The discovery of&nbsp;the farce and the struggle to&nbsp;be&nbsp;recognized</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/d49/054/13c12558fe9a8b567243cb864b.jpg><p>Unaware that she was not being credited for her own art, Margaret couldn’t do&nbsp;anything about&nbsp;it. But after paying a&nbsp;visit to&nbsp;the club where her paintings were sold, she finally learned what was happening. Walter’s excuse was that customers would not buy paintings by&nbsp;a&nbsp;divorced woman.</p><p>After 10&nbsp;years of&nbsp;their relationship, the marriage <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>ended</a>. Years later, she moved to&nbsp;<a href=# title=Hawaii data-link=tag>Hawaii</a> and remarried. Margaret exposed Walter’s lie in&nbsp;an&nbsp;interview on&nbsp;a&nbsp;radio show in&nbsp;the 1970s. In&nbsp;the 1980s, Walter made a&nbsp;statement, claiming that his ex-wife was lying, and she prosecuted him for defamation.</p><p><h2>Margaret had to&nbsp;paint a&nbsp;picture in&nbsp;court to&nbsp;prove that she was the author of&nbsp;her own art.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/d28/d3f/cbdf825c4a98ca380f28d1685a.jpg><p>The trial began in&nbsp;1986&nbsp;and, on&nbsp;one occasion, the judge asked the 2&nbsp;parties to&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>paint</a> a&nbsp;picture in&nbsp;front of&nbsp;everyone present. The intention was to&nbsp;determine the true authorship of&nbsp;the works. Walter refused, saying he&nbsp;had a&nbsp;sore shoulder, while Margaret accepted the challenge. In&nbsp;less than 1&nbsp;hour, she presented to&nbsp;all the people who were following the case a&nbsp;painting that validated everything she had stated on&nbsp;that radio program 10&nbsp;years prior.</p><p>Margaret won the lawsuit and the right to&nbsp;compensation in&nbsp;the amount of&nbsp;$4&nbsp;million. However, she was unable to&nbsp;obtain any of&nbsp;the money she had accumulated from her own work during this farce that lasted for years because Walter had spent the entire fortune. He, in&nbsp;turn, continued to&nbsp;claim that he&nbsp;was the true author of&nbsp;the paintings until his death in&nbsp;the 2000s.</p><p><h2>The world learned the story thanks to&nbsp;a&nbsp;film released in&nbsp;2014.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/2ea/5b6/93f57657d3ac045deaf71d7647.jpg><p>In&nbsp;2014, director Tim Burton released the film, <i>Big Eyes</i>, which told the world Margaret’s story about her struggle for recognition and overcoming&nbsp;it. The cast featured actress Amy Adams in&nbsp;the role of&nbsp;the painter, and Christoph Waltz played Walter Keane. In&nbsp;addition, the film’s production <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>recreated</a> nearly 200 of&nbsp;Margaret’s paintings and brought more attention to&nbsp;the artist’s work, which earned renewed public interest.</p><p>The film received 2&nbsp;BAFTA Award <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>nominations</a> and another Critics Choice Award for Best Music. Amy Adams won the Capri Actress Awards and a&nbsp;Golden Globe for her <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>performance</a>. When asked about the film, Margaret <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>stated</a> that the movie was very accurate when explaining what happened in&nbsp;real life, and she found it&nbsp;wonderful.</p><p><h2>The differences between the work and reality</h2></p><p>The film, <i>Big Eyes</i>,<i> </i>helped Margaret Keane receive the recognition she deserved for her large collection of&nbsp;work that is&nbsp;still around today. Of&nbsp;course, like any other film production, it&nbsp;has some <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>differences</a> in&nbsp;relation to&nbsp;reality. One of&nbsp;them was that, in&nbsp;the film, Walter never tried to&nbsp;paint the paintings that were sold. In&nbsp;real life, he&nbsp;did, but without success.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/b5f/50d/0ec13d5ece8e64d7c0ae5e5d77.jpg><p>Another change made by&nbsp;the filmmakers was that, in&nbsp;the movie, no&nbsp;one visited the couple’s mansion. However, Walter used to&nbsp;invite local high society and even celebrities to&nbsp;his home. None of&nbsp;them, however, could enter the studio, where Margaret painted about 16&nbsp;hours a&nbsp;day. Therefore, she was never seen.</p><p><h2>The change in&nbsp;her art and life today</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/a9f/1b8/150dce509286f7d07c52649b3c.jpg><p>Margaret currently lives in&nbsp;Napa, California and continues to&nbsp;create charming and successful works of&nbsp;art. Her work, which gained even more prominence after the release of&nbsp;the feature film that tells her life story, is&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>sold</a> at&nbsp;Keane Eyes Gallery, founded in&nbsp;1992 in&nbsp;San Francisco. After winning the legal battle for recognition, her paintings became increasingly cheerful, with smiling children in&nbsp;some of&nbsp;them.</p><p>Did you already know Margaret Keane’s story?
