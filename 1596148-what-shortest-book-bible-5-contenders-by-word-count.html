Here are the five shortest Bible books by verses.</p><li><strong>2 John:</strong> It has 13 verses. It is an epistle dedicated to the elect lady and her children. It discusses the importance of truth and love and warns against false teaching.</li><li><strong>3 John:</strong> It has 15 verses. It is a personal letter from Apostle John to Gaius acknowledging and applauding his hospitality while warning against Diotrephes's adverse influences.</li><li><strong>Obadiah:</strong> It has 21 verses. It is one of the prophetic books of the Old Testament, and it discusses the judgment of Edom and the restoration of Israel.</li><li><strong>Philemon:</strong> It has 25 verses.
