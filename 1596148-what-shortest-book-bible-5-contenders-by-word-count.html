The original language of the Old Testament is Hebrew, while the original language of the New Testament is Greek. Here are the five shortest books of the Bible based on the word count in their original language.</p><p class=align-left><strong>3 John</strong></p>This book was originally written in Greek and is the shortest in the Bible, at approximately 219 words.

Therefore, it does not necessarily mean that the book with the least words is the shortest regarding verses. Here are the five shortest Bible books by verses.</p><li><strong>2 John:</strong> It has 13 verses. It is an epistle dedicated to the elect lady and her children. It discusses the importance of truth and love and warns against false teaching.</li><li><strong>3 John:</strong> It has 15 verses. It is a personal letter from Apostle John to Gaius acknowledging and applauding his hospitality while warning against Diotrephes's adverse influences.</li><li><strong>Obadiah:</strong> It has 21 verses. It is one of the prophetic books of the Old Testament, and it discusses the judgment of Edom and the restoration of Israel.</li><li><strong>Philemon:</strong> It has 25 verses. This epistle from Paul to Philemon urges him to forgive and <a id=https://www.legit.ng/1136172-prayer-points-mercy-favour-god.html href=#>have mercy</a> on Onesimus, his brother in Christ and his runaway slave.</li><li><strong>Jude:</strong> It has 25 verses.
