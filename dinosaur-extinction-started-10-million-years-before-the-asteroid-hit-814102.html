And then disappeared. History says it&nbsp;was a&nbsp;huge city-sized asteroid that came from space and hit the land of&nbsp;the Yucatán peninsula around 66&nbsp;million years ago.</p><p>It&nbsp;caused terrible environmental changes, debris in&nbsp;the air blocking the sunlight, so&nbsp;the plants couldn’t survive. Temperatures on&nbsp;Earth’s surface plunged, animals were struggling to&nbsp;survive&nbsp;— until they finally went extinct.</p><p>At&nbsp;least, that’s something many paleontologists believe happened. Now they found out dinosaurs were about to&nbsp;go&nbsp;extinct even before the asteroid. Their diversity started to&nbsp;go&nbsp;down 10&nbsp;million years before the asteroid&nbsp;— older long-living species didn’t evolve enough to&nbsp;adapt to&nbsp;all changes in&nbsp;the environment, such as&nbsp;higher sea levels, massive volcanic activity, cooler periods. Dinosaurs preferred a&nbsp;warm <a href=# title=climate data-link=tag>climate</a> because it&nbsp;helped them to&nbsp;keep a&nbsp;stable body temperature.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/5d4/366/8c4dc452c1862830f164d30733.png><p>Dinosaurs lived on&nbsp;all 7&nbsp;continents, even in&nbsp;<a href=# title=Antarctica data-link=tag>Antarctica</a>. That’s because it&nbsp;wasn’t all ice back then. Around 90&nbsp;million years ago, Antarctica was a&nbsp;swampy rainforest with a&nbsp;warm, pleasant climate. It&nbsp;was even in&nbsp;a&nbsp;different location, only 560 miles from the then-South Pole.</p><p>That was the time of&nbsp;the warmest climate on&nbsp;our planet&nbsp;— the sea level was 560 feet higher than today, and the tropical sea surface could reach temperatures up&nbsp;to&nbsp;95&nbsp;F. Antarctica still had something like polar night&nbsp;— months without sunlight&nbsp;— but the climate around the South Pole was mild and temperate, with no&nbsp;ice masses. Dinosaurs didn’t shed their skin in&nbsp;one long piece like today’s reptiles do&nbsp;— scientists believe they shed it&nbsp;in&nbsp;small pieces, had something like “dinosaur” fur.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/599/28b/4e60b056e1a33e45a18636cfd1.png><p>There was a&nbsp;dinosaur Pegomastax that looked like a&nbsp;cross between a&nbsp;porcupine and a&nbsp;parrot; it&nbsp;had 1-inch long jaws and ate plants. It&nbsp;had a&nbsp;short beak, and self-sharpening long teeth. They were like scissors this small dinosaur used to&nbsp;slice up&nbsp;plants.</p><p>Our modern lion has a&nbsp;mighty bite, but a&nbsp;big and scary T.&nbsp;Rex bites more than two times stronger. The king of&nbsp;the dinosaurs has the strongest bite amongst all land animals, 3.5 times stronger than today’s record holder, the Australian saltwater crocodile. It&nbsp;also had the longest teeth&nbsp;— almost 10&nbsp;inches long, the length of&nbsp;an&nbsp;iPad.</p><p>Most modern animals are either warm-blooded or&nbsp;cold-blooded&nbsp;— dinosaurs were somewhere in&nbsp;between. Scientists think they mainly were mesotherms, which means the activity of&nbsp;their muscles would warm their bodies, but their body temperature could fluctuate too.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/66d/c3c/d7fd7051c2a9f7d0223ce1cf84.png><p>Many dinosaurs, such as&nbsp;Triceratops and Stegosaurus, had spikes, plates, horns, crests, or&nbsp;other bizarre structures on&nbsp;their bodies. In&nbsp;the beginning, scientists thought that’s for things like defense&nbsp;— they had neither sharp teeth nor hooked claws on&nbsp;the toes to&nbsp;hunt. But soon, they expanded the theory&nbsp;— it&nbsp;was probably the way to&nbsp;impress their mates and identify members of&nbsp;their kind.</p><p>One species, namely Pachycephalosaurus, even had a&nbsp;funky bone hat on&nbsp;top of&nbsp;its head. Scary, tall as&nbsp;buildings, massive&nbsp;— that’s what we&nbsp;saw in&nbsp;movies, but dinosaurs mainly were human-sized or&nbsp;even smaller. Bigger bones were easier to&nbsp;be&nbsp;fossilized, so&nbsp;that’s why we&nbsp;mostly find gigantic species.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/be1/638/c181485ea7a5ec56bd177093dd.png><p>Eoraptor, or&nbsp;“dawn stealer,” was the first-named dinosaur. Small and toothy, (like&nbsp;me) it&nbsp;got its name because it&nbsp;comes from the dawn of&nbsp;the Dinosaur Age; the size of&nbsp;a&nbsp;German Shepard, but probably not that friendly. Arched back, sharp, bony plates, curved tail&nbsp;— Ankylosaurus were some sort of&nbsp;giant, muck spikier dinosaur version of&nbsp;an&nbsp;armadillo.</p><p>Its weak spot was the soft underbelly, but meat-eating dinos that were after this one had to&nbsp;flip that guy first to&nbsp;get there. Still, it&nbsp;was really tough because of&nbsp;their impressive gear&nbsp;— scientists believe they even had bony eyelids. Some dinos ate meat, others plants, and some of&nbsp;them could nibble even on&nbsp;pebbles. One dinosaur called Gallimimus couldn’t physically chew all those plants it&nbsp;ate, so&nbsp;it&nbsp;would ingest pebbles to&nbsp;mash up&nbsp;the food.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/1ee/6ec/01c6e453cab6e1e217f172b07d.png><p>Gallimimus looked like some weird alien mix of&nbsp;dinosaur and bird. But, it&nbsp;couldn’t dribble a&nbsp;basketball because its wrists weren’t capable of&nbsp;keeping the palms parallel to&nbsp;the floor. And they had no&nbsp;3-point shot. The largest dinos were plant-eaters.</p><p>Meat-eaters or&nbsp;so-called theropods were mostly smaller. One reason is&nbsp;that plant-eating dinosaurs were very greedy; they would devour enormous amounts of&nbsp;food, sometimes even swallowing the entire branches without chewing. Some of&nbsp;the biggest could eat a&nbsp;ton of&nbsp;food every day&nbsp;— like a&nbsp;bus-sized pile. There were also more plant-eating dinosaurs than the other ones.</p><p>Scientists are still not sure if&nbsp;meat-eating dinosaurs were able to&nbsp;coordinate themselves and hunt in&nbsp;groups&nbsp;— they were probably unfriendly towards each other, especially when it&nbsp;comes to&nbsp;sharing prey.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/d17/b31/7a500f54bd91a08c10a78646b3.png><p>Fossils and the shape of&nbsp;delicate bones in&nbsp;the eye tell dinosaurs mostly roamed around during the day. Scientists think only smaller meat-eating dinos like Velociraptor were active during the night. They were after those small mammals snuffing around and trying to&nbsp;find food while big dinosaurs were asleep&nbsp;— or&nbsp;that’s what they thought.</p><p>Those small mammals were usually burrowing animals that survived both dinosaur reign and ice age hiding underground. Not all mammals were hiding from dinosaurs -some small but sneaky creatures, like Repenomamus, would steal the eggs from big dinosaurs&nbsp;— which was a&nbsp;big thing considering they had to&nbsp;trick the mama dinosaur first.</p><p>Researchers believe dinos tried to&nbsp;flap on&nbsp;the ground to&nbsp;get faster at&nbsp;running up&nbsp;inclined terrains to&nbsp;catch their prey. Such behavior caused them to&nbsp;learn how to&nbsp;fly&nbsp;— which of&nbsp;course, happened through thousands of&nbsp;years. Dinosaurs were fuzzy and fluffy. They are related to&nbsp;birds, but even those earlier dino species that didn’t fly had feathers&nbsp;— like gigantic, scary...Fuzzy T. Rex!</p><p>Movies lied&nbsp;— you just can’t stand still and expect a&nbsp;T.&nbsp;Rex would pass you&nbsp;by. Its vision was probably better than the one today’s raptors have. Even without&nbsp;it, they still had a&nbsp;pretty good sense of&nbsp;smell. Running could help it&nbsp;though, scientists calculated T.&nbsp;Rex could probably run at&nbsp;12&nbsp;mph&nbsp;— it&nbsp;would shatter its bones at&nbsp;a&nbsp;greater speed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/932/c47/bffeea5db48236dd3b852134b9.png><p>Some dinos had tails more than 45&nbsp;feet long. Tails helped them to&nbsp;keep their balance when running, especially those that walked on&nbsp;two legs. Velociraptors were not like raptors we&nbsp;see on&nbsp;the screen, but more like some sort of&nbsp;prehistoric chickens; small&nbsp;— a&nbsp;little big bigger than a&nbsp;turkey, 2&nbsp;feet in&nbsp;height&nbsp;— probably had feathers, hollow bones just like birds, mostly loners. But they were probably among the smartest dinos&nbsp;— their brain was big compared to&nbsp;their bodies.</p><p>They were as&nbsp;intelligent as&nbsp;today’s ostriches. The name “Velociraptor” means speedy thief. Stegosaurs had a&nbsp;pretty big body, spiky plates, and a&nbsp;tiny brain, the size of&nbsp;a&nbsp;walnut or&nbsp;lime. But, at&nbsp;least it&nbsp;had its own air conditioner&nbsp;— researchers found out its spikes were filled with veins that transferred blood and developed a&nbsp;theory they were cooling its giant body that way.</p><p>Dimorphodon was the flying reptile with a&nbsp;wingspan of&nbsp;8&nbsp;feet and multipurpose teeth&nbsp;— teeth in&nbsp;the upper jaw were longer, sharper, and better for catching food from the water. The teeth in&nbsp;the bottom jaw were better for holding the game in&nbsp;transit. One of&nbsp;the first potential dinosaur discoveries was in&nbsp;China, 3,500 years ago.</p><p>No&nbsp;one knew about dinosaurs then, so&nbsp;people thought teeth they found could belong to&nbsp;dragons. The Hadrosaurus was a&nbsp;duck-billed dino with more than 1,000 teeth&nbsp;— when they would fall off, it&nbsp;could grow new ones indefinitely. Dinosaurs’ eggs were pretty big, some as&nbsp;big as&nbsp;beachballs. Now, that’s an&nbsp;omelet.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/e0b/73b/0bc5ae5373a1cce7a0a28f35cc.png><p>The Baryonyx was a&nbsp;big fan of&nbsp;the fish. Its name means “a&nbsp;heavy claw,” and it&nbsp;got it&nbsp;because of&nbsp;big, extended claws that were pretty sharp and made up&nbsp;the thumb of&nbsp;each hand. When catching fish, they used the claws like spears. Mosasaurs, also popular in&nbsp;movies, was not quite a&nbsp;dinosaur but a&nbsp;marine lizard, closely related to&nbsp;monitor lizards and snakes.</p><p>Like a&nbsp;snake, it&nbsp;had jaws that could expand when swallowing the food. These creatures were speedy; they had a&nbsp;tail fin and flipper-like paddles instead of&nbsp;arms and legs. Researchers believe they had a&nbsp;weak sense of&nbsp;smell and poor perception of&nbsp;depth, so&nbsp;they had to&nbsp;develop a&nbsp;unique hunting technique&nbsp;— waiting for their snack to&nbsp;come up&nbsp;to&nbsp;the surface for some air.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZLGqus6smK6qXZrFtbXNnKuip55iwLWt0a2cnWVhZXqutculoKimXa6yor7SZpmenp%2Bnsm7Ax55kmqukmr%2BwtcNmn6KsXW1%2BdX2Pa2Y%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./alex-gibney-camerimage-1235380672.html>&#171;&nbsp;Documentary Filmmaker Alex Gibney to Be Honored by Camerimage</a>
