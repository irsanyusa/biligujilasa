His father was a police officer, and his mother was a hair stylist.</p><p class=align-left>During his childhood days, Webster was a naughty child and was kicked out of schools several times. His parents could not bear with their troublesome son and were forced to send him to a martial arts school.</p><p class=align-left>The move helped him discover his potential in kickboxing. He became a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">heavyweight black belt</a> before claiming an undefeated record as an amateur kickboxer. His exceptional performance elevated him to a teacher in the school.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/3782d2abb9f0e66f.jpg><p class=align-left>Webster developed an interest in acting but first had to work as a stockbroker, then in import and export business.

In most cases, with <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">the new technology</a>, actors are made to appear younger than their real ages. You need further research to find out their exact age.</p><p class=align-left>The same applies to Webster. The actor is currently 47 years old and looks energetic to produce more films in the future. Perhaps this is the best age to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">win an Oscar award</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/519644fcf40bd13d.jpg><h3>Victor Webster height</h3><p class=align-left>Height is no longer a factor of success in Hollywood films. There are many hit films produced by short actors of up to 5’8” which has largely shaped the industry.</p><p class=align-left>These actors are mostly disguised to appear taller on films by either putting on taller shoes or using higher grounds than their co-actors.</p><p class=align-left>Webster, with a height of 6' 5" (1.96 m) would rightly fit in the bracket of <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">tallest Hollywood actors</a>.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/ceea92ab0b4f0ea3.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=30><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Michael K. Williams bio: Scar, wife, net worth, Lovecraft Country</span></p></a><h3>Victor Webster wife</h3><p class=align-left>Who is Victor Webster married to? It is interesting to note that the tall actor has no wife and has never been married.</p><p class=align-left>At 47 years old, he is still a bachelor. He seems to enjoy his status and prefers keeping everything secret, but will he finally wed in 2020?</p><h3>Victor Webster girlfriend</h3><p class=align-left>The handsome hunk has attracted many women who fall for his charming looks and masculine body. The only concern is that most of his relationships reach their first-anniversary mark</p><p class=align-left>In 1999, Webster began <a id=https://www.whosdatedwho.com/dating/victor-webster-and-krista-allen href=# rel="nofollow noopener">dating actress Krista Allen</a> but they had been dating a few months before they parted ways.</p><p class=align-left>Among other ladies the star has dated are the Miss Norway 1997 and the 2006 Maxim’s woman of the year, Monica Hansen, back in 2015, which also was short-lived.</p><p class=align-left>He also dated a Canadian actress Serinda Swan, who starred as DEA Special Agent in the popular USA Network series <i>Graceland</i>. The relationship also went for a few months before they broke up.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/3e16ec4f2584e114.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=29><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>An interesting Randy Quaid bio: Net worth, career, and family life</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Model Leilani Dowding is the latest to date Webster, with the couple once anticipated to tie the knot.

It is difficult to support this sentiment about the celebrity who has had open relationships with women.</p><h3>Victor Webster children</h3><p class=align-left>Men are generally advised to have families and children before they turn 40. While this may only be a research, there might be some facts in it. At 47, without a wife or any child, perhaps Victor Webster actor should be more than worried for himself than how his fans are concerned about his family life. Maybe he likes it that way, or bigger plans and surprises are coming soon.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/eee0c9d2a5ad001f.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=30><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Jorge Garcia's bio: weight loss, wife, net worth, where is he now?</span></p></a><h3>How much is Victor Webster worth?</h3><p class=align-left>According to<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"> <i>Celebrity Net Worth</i></a><i>,</i> Victor Webster net worth is $3 million.</p><h2>FAQs about the actor</h2><p class=align-left>Here are answers to the most frequently asked questions about the actor:</p><h3>Is actor Victor Webster married?</h3><p class=align-left>No, he is not yet married.</p><h3>How old is actor Victor Webster?</h3><p class=align-left>He is currently 47 y/o, as he was born on 7th February 1973.</p><h3>Where does Victor Webster live?</h3><p class=align-left><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">According to virtualgrobetrotting.com</a>, his house is in Los Angeles.</p><p class=align-left>Victor Webster is a sensational actor who has graced the screens with success.
