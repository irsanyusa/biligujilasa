He grew up in a Catholic household. His mother works as a nurse.</p><p class=align-left>Growing up, he had many challenges during his school life but he was eventually able to<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"> finish high school</a>. He attended St. Joseph by-the-sea High School, then Tottenville High School. He later transferred out of Tottenville and joined Xaverian High School in Brooklyn where he graduated in 2011. After high school, he joined the Brooklyn Height's St. Francis College but he<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"> eventually dropped out</a>.</p><p class=align-left>Career-wise, he is both an actor and a comedian. Pete, however, seems to love comedy more. His mother said that due to his father's death, he was always sad. She said that she started driving her son around to comedy shows and gigs when he was just <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">sixteen-years-old</a> because "doing comedy made him really, happy".

I loved the power and the freedom — you gotta listen to what I have to say,” he added. “It was the first time I felt that way.”<p class=align-left>He rose quickly in the comedy ranks to where he was opening tours for Nick Cannon and Bob Levy. He got stints on the MTV shows “Guy Code” and “Wild ’n Out". He met comedian Amy Schumer in a comedy club where he was performing and she later cast him in her movie <i>Trainwreck</i>.</p><p class=align-left>He has had other <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">acting stints in movies</a> and series such as <i>The Angry Birds movie 2, The Dirt, Brooklyn Nine-Nine </i>among others<i>.</i></p><p class=align-left>At just 25 years old, Mr Davidson is the youngest cast member of the current <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Saturday Night Live </a>(SNL) cast. <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Bill Harder</a> helped the comedian get discovered by SNL.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/d435e1a4d945333e.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Sam Worthington: Top facts about the amazing actor</span></p></a><h3>Pete Davidson dad</h3><p class=align-left>Pete Davidson dad died in the line of duty as he worked as a firefighter in New York. He passed away during the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">11th September 2001</a> (9/11) attacks.

In a bid to honour his dad, Pete posted <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">two pictures of him </a>last year.

It got to a point whereby he ripped out all the hair from his head until he was bald. This escalated to a point whereby he got suicidal thoughts. Thankfully, he did not go through with it. He credits Kid Cudi's song <i>Man on the Moon </i>for essentially saving his life.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/417290c88fda3332.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Meet Cody Fern: what is the American Horror Story star up to now?</span></p></a><h3>Pete Davidson height</h3><p class=align-left>The comedian/actor is quite tall.
